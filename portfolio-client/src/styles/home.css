  headline
  This CSS code would make the Full Stack Blockchain Developer part stand out with bold text and a darker color, while the Digital Marketing Specialist part would be in a lighter color and italic text for a touch of elegance. Using display: inline-block for each part of the title would also make it easier to differentiate the two parts. Finally, increasing the font size and line-height of the title would improve readability and make it more visually appealing overall.

  This CSS code would make the first sentence stand out with a larger font size and bold text,
   every other sentence a lighter color to create visual interest, 
   and the last sentence in italic text for a touch of elegance. Additionally, 
  increasing the font size and line-height of the paragraph and adding 
  some space between each sentence would improve readability and make the paragraph more visually appealing overall.
